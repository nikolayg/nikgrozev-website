Hi there,

My name is Nikolay and 
I’m a software engineer and researcher interested in everything to do with
software development, distributes systems, programming languages, functional programming, 
teaching programming, and building cool stuff.

In my previous life, I was an academic and I hold a PhD in Computer Science from the
<a href="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/" title="http://www.unimelb.edu.au/">University of Melbourne</a>, Australia.
My PhD was about designing large scale web applications so they can use multiple Clouds. 
I developed adaptive architectures and used online machine learning techniques 
to “learn” the application’s behaviour in real time and allocate computing resources adequately.

You can check out my <a href="/publications">publications</a> and <a href="/blog">blog</a> to 
learn more about my work.
