# Introduction

This post is a cheat sheet of commonly used shell commands and tools. 
It is meant to serve as a quick reference guide that you can consult when developing scripts or when working 
extensively with the Bash shell. It refers to tools which are usually present in all Linux distributions and OS X, 
or which can be easily installed with the usual package managers. The only exception is **systemd** which is 
present on most modern Linux distributions (with a few exceptions).

<div id='common-bash-commands' />
# Common Bash Commands

<div id='finding-files-find-egrep' />
## Finding Files (find, egrep)

```bash
# Find file recursively
find . -name test.txt

# -iname makes it case insensitive
find . -iname Test.txt

# All files and direcotries that match the pattern
find . -name "*.css"

# The same, but only files/directories this time
find . -type f -name "*.css"
find . -type d -name "*.css"

# Using posix/standard regex in the path (not just name)
find . -regex ".*[A-Z]+.*.md"

# Find files by size - use k,M and G for kilo/mega/gigabyte
find . -size 50M
find . -size +50M -size -100M

# Avoid recursiveness by limiting the depth - i.e. like ls
find . -maxdepth 1 -name "*.css"

# Use (a/c/m)time to search by last access/change/modify time (measured in days)
# Files modified 30-60 days ago:  
find . -mtime +30 â€“mtime -60

# Use (a/c/m)min to serach by minutes
# Files accessed during the last 45 mins:
find . -amin -45

# Finding files by content - prints all matches
find . -type f -exec egrep "^.*pattern" /dev/null {} \;

# The same, but without the matches - i.e. just file names
find . -type f -exec egrep -l "^.*pattern" /dev/null {} \;

# The same as the above two with the grep command
egrep -r '^.*pattern'
egrep -lr '^.*pattern'
```

<div id='interacting-with-servers-curl' />
## Interacting with Servers (curl)
```bash
# Downloads the content. Tries to guess the protocol - e.g. HTTP, FTP
curl example.com > example.txt
curl ftp://myftpsite.com --user myname:mypassword  > example.txt

# Curl plays well with the tidy command, which pretty-prints HTML:
curl example.com | tidy -qi

# Use verbose mode to see headers
curl -v example.com

# Add headers to your request:
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "authToken: secret" example.com

# Web sites like google.com often respond with redirections (302/301)
# To follow the redirection use -L
curl -L google.com

# Resuming a canceled/failed download
curl -C - example.com

# HTTP POST, PUT, DELETE
curl -X POST example.com -d "Request Body"

# To use HTTP Basic Authentication
curl -u 'username:password' example.com/auth

# To access insecure HTTPS connections
curl -k https://example.com/secure.php
```

<div id='inspect-ports-and-file-handles-lsof' />
## Inspect Ports and File Handles (lsof)

```bash
# List all current network connections
lsof -i

# List processes listening on a given port
lsof -i :25

# Inspect what files/network resources a process or command is using
lsof -p 10075
lsof -c ls
```

<div id='pattern-matching-and-replacing-sed' />
## Pattern Matching and Replacing (sed)

```bash
# Removing lines (1st and 3rd) from a file
sed -e '1d' -e '3d' 'test.txt' > 'result.txt'

# Replace all occurrences of a word with another
sed -e 's/cat/dog/g' 'input.txt'

# The same but case insensitive
sed -e 's/cat/dog/ig' 'input.txt'

# Replace by regex
sed -r 's/(\s+|,|\.)/-/g' 'test.txt'

# Replace by regex using groups
sed -r 's/(\w+)/ (\1) /g' 'test.txt'
```

<div id='working-with-tabular-data-awk' />
## Working with Tabular Data (awk)

```bash
# Getting columns from tabular data
awk '{ print $2, $4 }' text.txt
ls -l | awk '{ print $2, $4 }'

# Using custom separator
echo "1,2,3,4,5" | awk -F, '{ print $2, $4 }'

# Arithmetic and formatting
echo "1 2 3 4 5" | awk '{ printf "%.2f - %.2f - %.2f\n", $2, $2 + $3, $4 }'

# Skip initial rows (e.g. a header)
ls -l | awk 'FNR > 1 { print $1 }'

# Select a specific row
ls -l | awk 'FNR == 2 { print $1 }'
```

<div id='working-with-json-jq' />
## Working with JSON (jq)

```bash
# Sample JSON data
read -r -d '' jsonTxt << EOM
{"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]}
EOM

# Pretty print some JSON
echo $jsonTxt | jq .
jq . jsont.txt

# Get an object's property
echo $jsonTxt | jq .employees

# Get an array element
echo $jsonTxt | jq .employees[1]

# Unpack an array of objects
echo $jsonTxt | jq .employees[]

# Get a property from all objects
echo $jsonTxt | jq .employees[].firstName

# Filter an array by value
echo $jsonTxt | jq '.employees[] | select(.firstName == "John")'

# Filter an array by regex
echo $jsonTxt | jq '.employees[] | select(.firstName | match(["jo.+", "gi"]))'
```

<div id='working-with-archives-tar-zip-unzip' />
## Working with Archives (tar, zip, unzip)

tar xvzf archive_name.tar.gz

# Zip a single file
zip file.zip filepath

# Make a zip from a folder
zip -r archive.zip dirname

# Zip a file/folder without storing the path to it
zip -j file.zip filepath

# Unzip/Extract
unzip file.zip
unzip file.zip ./destination
```

<div id='file-permissions-ls-chmod-chown' />
## File Permissions (ls, chmod, chown)
```bash
# Check permissions - prints r/w/x flags for owner-user/group/others
# Also prints the owner user and groups
ls -l path

# Change file owner
chown owner-user file
chown owner-user:owner-group file

# Change owner recursively
chown owner-user -R folder-path

# Giver permissions (i.e. r/w/x) to user/group/others/all (u/g/o/a)
chmod g+w file
chmod a+r file
chmod ug+wx file

# Remove permissions (i.e. r/w/x) to user/group/others/all (u/g/o/a)

# Get an element by index
echo ${arr[0]}

# Set an element by index
arr[1]='TWO'

# Get the length
echo ${#arr[@]}

# Array slicing in the form [start_after_index]:[slice_length]

```bash
# List all services
systemctl list-unit-files --type=service

# Start/stop/restart/reload/enable a Services
systemctl start some.service
systemctl stop some.service
systemctl restart some.service
systemctl reload some.service
systemctl enable some.service
systemctl disable some.service

# Check the config of a service
systemctl show some.service

# Check the log/journal of systemd events

# Events for a service
journalctl --unit=some.service

# Events since last boot or from today
journalctl -b
journalctl --since=today

# View error events
journalctl -p err
```

<div id='creating-a-new-service-script-in-etc-init-d' />
## Creating a new Service (script in /etc/init.d)

To create a service, place its script in - **"/etc/init.d"** (on some distros in **"/etc/rc.d/init.d/"**). 
The code of the script should handle start, stop, restart, etc. The following example 
(taken from [here](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/20357/how-can-i-make-a-script-in-etc-init-d-start-at-boot)) 
demonstrates a skeleton of such a script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# === Sample Script ===

# Source function library.
. /etc/init.d/functions

start() {
    # code to start app comes here
    # example: daemon program_name &
}

stop() {
    # code to stop app comes here
    # example: killproc program_name
}

case "$1" in
    start)
       start
       ;;
    stop)
       stop
       ;;
    restart)
       stop
       start
       ;;
    status)
       # code to check status of app comes here
       # example: status program_name
       ;;
    *)
       echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|status|restart}"
esac

exit 0
```
