<p>
  Github now allows <a href="http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/05/07/rendering-notebooks-on-github/">ipython/jupyter notebooks</a> 
  to be viewed directly in the browser. I though that is a great way to create a small reference card/cheatsheet of Scala syntax. 
  it could be found <a href="https://github.com/nikolayg/ScalaJupyterTutorial/blob/master/Scala%20Tutorial.ipynb">here</a>.

  Overall, I was impressed with this new feature and everything worked as expected out of the box. 
  The only thing I couldn't achieve was a working table of the contents for the notebook.
